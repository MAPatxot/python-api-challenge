I have gone and redid the assignment from scratch as much as possible, took it step by step. Found my mistake simply at that I never exported a new CSV from the WeatherPy (New Dataframe)

In my first try I was using the CSV (cities.csv) from WeatherPy into VacationPy, which casued me issues when I ran the code that found the parameters of the hotel, but more specifically, it returned an error where it displayed "Status: OK"

With my new Dataframe (weather_df), I was able to run and complete the code and the new HeatMap with an added layer of Hotel Locations
